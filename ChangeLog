	* Makefile.am: Remove AM_CFLAGS; it's not appropriate as a spot
	for overridable defaults.

	* src/teseq.c (print_gxdm_info): Ensure we don't index the
	desig_strs string unless the index is in the appropriate
	range. Thanks to Bruno Haible for spotting the bug.

	* tests/iso-2022/input, tests/iso-2022/output: Tests for
	print_gxdm_info fix ("Esc $ z").
