Version 1.1.1

* Updated all files to reflect new email address for maintainer:
  micah@addictivecode.org (previous address, micah@cowan.name, is no
  longer valid)

* Added links in the (Texinfo) manual to playable videos that
  demonstrate basic teseq functionality, and how to use teseq to create
  _and edit_ interactive terminal demos:

  * https://asciinema.org/a/7443
  * https://asciinema.org/a/7445

* Added example in the manual for using teseq to strip escapes out of a
  typescript file.

* BUG FIX: Fixed an issue where teseq could spin indefinitely churning
  out \xFF bytes on no further input. Input from a command such as
    $ printf '\033!!\177'
  would produce this issue.

  This issue was discovered by means of american fuzzy lop,
  http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl/

* BUG FIX: Fixed an issue with \x7F (DEL) being treated as a valid final
  character for control sequences, and being printed on teseq's output
  (which should not be printing non-whitespace control characters).

Version 1.1

* Colorized output now supported via the --color (or --colour) option,
  and the TESEQ_COLORS environment variable.

* Descriptions and labels for non-standard controls from DEC, Xterm,
  Rxvt, etc, are now always issued, without the need for the -x option.

* Reseq now recognizes "halt" (@@@) lines (with --halts option), waiting
  for keypress before continuing.

* Teseq now identifies which charset is being switched, by its ISO IR
  registration.

* BUG FIX: Teseq could crash on the input, `\033$z'.

Version 1.0.0

* Initial release!
