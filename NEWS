Version 1.1

* Colorized output now supported via the --color (or --colour) option,
  and the TESEQ_COLORS environment variable.

* Descriptions and labels for non-standard controls from DEC, Xterm,
  Rxvt, etc, are now always issued, without the need for the -x option.

* Reseq now recognizes "halt" (@@@) lines (with --halts option), waiting
  for keypress before continuing.

* Teseq now identifies which charset is being switched, by its ISO IR
  registration.

* BUG FIX: Teseq could crash on the input, `\033$z'.

Version 1.0.0

* Initial release!
