Other mouse stuff.

Report bugs to bug-teseq@gnu.org.

Reseq should complain about lines it doesn't recognize, so it can't
silently generate incomplete data from the output of future versions
of Teseq. Perhaps reserve some "safe" ones in advance.

Test input buffer overflow, unusual corner cases with escapes
processing in the various parser states. Single-line,
single-line-no-EOF for timings.

OSC stuff?

Gettext.
