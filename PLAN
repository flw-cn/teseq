TODO:

Code cleanup.
VT100/Xterm extensions.
Gettext.

Interpretation of graphical characters based on current state
(translation to UTF-8?).

FUTURE IDEAS:

Eventual support for matching control sequences against simpler entries
in the terminfo databases? Trivially, ones that do not rely on
parameters; next step would be ones that contain trivial parameter use
such as %p1%d.
