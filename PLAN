Reseq should complain about lines it doesn't recognize, so it can't
silently generate incomplete data from the output of future versions
of Teseq. Perhaps reserve some "safe" ones in advance.

Make the signal-handling state-finishing stuff dependent on whether
_output_ is a tty, rather than input (but keep the termios stuff
dependant on input). Turn off unbuffered I/O for sane cases, and offer
options to force buffered/unbuffered mode.

Add a divisor option to reseq for playback, like scriptreplay's. And
suppress delays < 0.0001, too.

Test input buffer overflow, unusual corner cases with escapes
processing in the various parser states. Single-line,
single-line-no-EOF for timings.

Deal with check, checkmk more sanely, in configure.ac.



Figure out what to do with teseq-post.sed.

Test terminal-mode stuff.

How to deal with xterm mouse reports? ...perhaps a special flag...

OSC stuff?

Line wrapping, and gettext. User-specifiable line-limits.
