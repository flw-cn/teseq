TODO:

Multibyte 94-set seqs with multiple intermediate bytes.
Make Eseq handle 2/00 intermediate byte properly for CSI (more standard CSI functions).
Document CSI functions.
Make Eseq handle sub-parameters (`:'-separated) properly.
Make Eseq handle other _possible_ nF functions, including other intermediate-byte 02/xx combos, and multibyte 96-sets.
Xterm extensions.

Interpretation of graphical characters based on current state (translation to UF-8?).

FUTURE IDEAS:

Eventual support for matching control sequences against simpler entries
in the terminfo databases? Trivially, ones that do not rely on
parameters; next step would be ones that contain trivial parameter use
such as %p1%d.
