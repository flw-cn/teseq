Reseq should complain about lines it doesn't recognize, so it can't
silently generate incomplete data from the output of future versions
of Teseq. Perhaps reserve some "safe" ones in advance.

Add a divisor option to reseq for playback, like scriptreplay's. And
suppress delays < 0.0001, too.

Test input buffer overflow, unusual corner cases with escapes
processing in the various parser states. Single-line,
single-line-no-EOF for timings. Exit status on I/O error. Use :bytes
in reseq, and verify that it can handle non-Unicode high-bytes
and the escape character (ISO-2022-JP).

Deal with check, checkmk, help2man (see hello) more sanely, in configure.ac.



Figure out what to do with teseq-post.sed.

Test terminal-mode stuff.

How to deal with xterm mouse reports? ...perhaps a special flag...

OSC stuff?

Line wrapping, and gettext. User-specifiable line-limits.
