Reseq should complain about lines it doesn't recognize, so it can't
silently generate incomplete data from the output of future versions
of Teseq. Perhaps reserve some "safe" ones in advance.

Add a divisor option to reseq for playback, like scriptreplay's. And
suppress delays < 0.0001, too.

Test input buffer overflow, unusual corner cases with escapes
processing in the various parser states. Single-line,
single-line-no-EOF for timings. Exit status on I/O error.

Deal with check, checkmk more sanely, in configure.ac.



Figure out what to do with teseq-post.sed.

Test terminal-mode stuff.

How to deal with xterm mouse reports? ...perhaps a special flag...

OSC stuff?

Line wrapping, and gettext. User-specifiable line-limits.
