This is the README file for Eseq.

Eseq is a tool for analyzing files that contain control characters
terminal control sequences. It is intended to be useful for diagnosing
terminal emulators, and programs that make heavy use of terminal
features (such as those based on the Curses library).

Eseq has no requirements beyond a normal Unix build environment.

Eseq ships with a companion program, Reseq, which translates the
output from Eseq back into its original source form.  Reseq is written
in the Perl programming language, and so requires perl in order to
run.

Eseq also ships with a suite of regression tests. Some of these are
written in relatively portable POSIX sh; some others require the Check
test library, available at http://check.sourceforge.net/. If changes
are made to the Check-based test suite sources (*.cm files), the
Checkmk processor, available at
http://micah.cowan.name/projects/checkmk/, will be required to
generate the tests.
