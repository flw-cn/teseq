This is the README file for GNU Teseq.

GNU Teseq is a tool for analyzing files that contain control characters
and terminal control sequences. It is intended to be useful for diagnosing
terminal emulators, and programs that make heavy use of terminal
features (such as those based on the Curses library).

GNU Teseq takes raw terminal data as input, like:

  ^[[1mHi^[[m there, world^H^H^H^H^Hearth

And spits out something like:

  : Esc [ 1 m
  & SGR: SELECT GRAPHIC RENDITION
  " Set bold text.
  |Hi|
  : Esc [ 0 m
  & SGR: SELECT GRAPHIC RENDITION
  " Clear graphic rendition to defaults.
  | there, world|
  . BS/^H BS/^H BS/^H BS/^H BS/^H
  |earth|.

The accompanying program `reseq' may then be used to reverse this
translated output back into its original form, if desired.


See the INSTALL file for information on how to build and install this
program.

Please report all bugs to bug-teseq@gnu.org.

Teseq has no requirements beyond a normal Unix build environment.

Teseq ships with a companion program, Reseq, which translates the
output from Teseq back into its original source form.  Reseq is written
in the Perl programming language, and so requires perl in order to
run.

Teseq also ships with a suite of regression tests. Some of these are
written in relatively portable POSIX sh; some others require the Check
test library, available at http://check.sourceforge.net/.

If changes are made to the Check-based test suite sources (*.cm files),
the Checkmk processor, available at
http://micah.cowan.name/projects/checkmk/, will be required to generate
the tests. At some point in the near future, Checkmk will be shipped as
part of Check, and will not need to be obtained separately.

GNU Teseq is free software. See the file COPYING for copying conditions.
